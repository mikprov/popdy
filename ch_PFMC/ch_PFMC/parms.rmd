## Gathering parameters for PMFC species

I'm gathering parameters for XX species which are managed by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council (see <https://www.pcouncil.org/>). A lot of the life history information I need is stored on Fishbase. Instead of clicking on each species webpage and recording life history values I'm going to webscrape Fishbase website to record this information. 

```{r}
Common_name <- c("Pacific Sardine","Pacific Mackerel")
#library(knitr)
#kable(inserttablehere, caption = "table caption here.")
```


```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
#code for plot here, echo=F does not print the code that generated plot
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
