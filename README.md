####Sensitivities of west coast fish stocks to environmental variability 

simulation_model.rmd - this is the main script that generates timeseries of eggs, spawners, and catch. in here it reads two other scripts: parameters_pacifichake.r and functions.r

parameters_pacifichake.r - parms specific for hake. need to figure out how to write code for other species

functions.r - these functions are general, not species specific. but will need to review them if life history is iteroperous/semelparous.
