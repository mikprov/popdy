## Checking Units: LEP
Lifetime egg production is the sum of: probability of being mature at age * weight at age * survival from age 0 to age a.
LEP calculations are used to calculate FLEP.

## Checking units: fecundity at age 
The top row of the Leslie matrix is fecundity at age: probability of being mature at age * weight at age
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
